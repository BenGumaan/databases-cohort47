## Week 3 Exercise

Last week you created an ERD for the database for storing food recipes.
How can you normalize your database based on what you learned this week?
In particular, try answering following questions and provide table definitions from the last week
and this week to explain the changes.

- Was your database already in 2NF / 3 NF?
    ##### Yes, it was.
- What changes did you have to do to normalize your database?
    ##### It is already normalized, and it's so because I made sure that all attributes are single-valued and all columns have unique names. I also eliminated both partial and transitive dependencies by decomposing single tables (with these dependencies) into 2 separate tables.
